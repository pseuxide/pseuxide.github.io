## Introduction

Hi there, today I'm going to talk about how I tackled Unity game hacking for the first time.
In this post, I'll use the game [Lethal Company](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966720/Lethal_Company/) as an example, but I will attentively craft the content to be as broadly applicable as possible.

Just never miss the quota.
