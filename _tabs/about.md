## Whoami

I am a Japanese man who loves to play around computers.
Not actively coding everyday, just only when I feel like I want.

I work as a web engineer at day time, and do low-key reverse engineering at midnight every now and then.

## About this blog

As a hobbyist low-level programmer, having my own blog allows me to document each step of my reverse engineering journey without losing my way.

Here's a list of topics you might encounter in this blog:

```md
Reverse engineering
Game hacking
Windows user mode low level programming
Windows kernel driver development
Hypervisor development
```
{: file='Things I find attractive'}

Some of these are subjects I'm actively diving into, while others are still on my to-do list.

I used to take notes on my github repo, gist or Notion but it's clear to store them as a blog form.
