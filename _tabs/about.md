Hi, welcome to my blog!

I'm a Japanese web engineer which having fun play around windows low level and a bit of kernel programming when i feel like i want.

My English proficiency is rather low yet I'll be striving to post some work i do or writeups in English down the road.

Hit me up through email or whatever if you are a reverse engineer :)
