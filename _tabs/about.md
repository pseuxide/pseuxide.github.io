## welcome to my blog!

As a hobbyist low-level programmer, having my own blog allows me to document each step of my reverse engineering journey without losing my way.

Here's a list of topics you might encounter on this blog:

```md
Reverse engineering
Game hacking
Windows user mode low level programming
Windows kernel driver development
Hypervisor
```
{: file='Things I find attractive'}

Some of these are subjects I'm actively diving into, while others are still on my to-do list.

Hit me up via email or X or pretty much anything if you are a reverse engineer.
