## Who am I

I am a Japanese man who loves to play around computers.

I work as a web engineer at day time, and do low-key reverse engineering at midnight.

## Welcome to my blog

As a hobbyist low-level programmer, having my own blog allows me to document each step of my reverse engineering journey without losing my way.

Here's a list of topics you might encounter on this blog:

```md
Reverse engineering
Game hacking
Windows user mode low level programming
Windows kernel driver development
Hypervisor
```
{: file='Things I find attractive'}

Some of these are subjects I'm actively diving into, while others are still on my to-do list.

I used to take notes on my github repo or gist but frankly speaking, it's clear to store them as a blog form.
