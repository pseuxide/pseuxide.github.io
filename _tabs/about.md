Hi, I'm vxcall

#### a web engineer

I have been working as a web engineer in Tokyo since 2021. In my job, I have experience in both back-end and front-end development, as well as coordinating and extending docker and CI/CD.

#### a reverse engineer

I began exploring reverse engineering in 2020 as one of my hobbies, my first ever output is [a CSGO cheat](https://github.com/vxcall/Dainsleif). Since then, I have studied reverse engineering with IDA in earnest whenever I felt like it, tried cheat development in Rustlang, studied kernel driver development, etc. I'm still halfway through all of these, but I enjoy it as a casual hobby.

## About this blog

I would like to write an article on my development and experience in the context of reverse engineering. It will be treated as a kind of note for myself, but I hope it will be of use to someone else in case it is of interest.

Here's a list of topics you might encounter in this blog:

```md
Reverse engineering
Deobfuscation and devirtualization
Windows kernel driver development
Hypervisor development
Web development
```
{: file='Things I find attractive'}

Some of these are subjects I'm actively diving into, while others are still on my to-do list.
